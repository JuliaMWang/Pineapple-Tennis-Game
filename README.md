# Pineapple-Tennis-Game
Directions:

In my two-player game Pineapple Tennis (created with Java on Eclipse),
the objective for each player is to prevent the pineapple from hitting
his/her wall. The players are allowed to move anywhere on the court.
Player one (the green tennis racket) controls the arrow keys in order
to move in the respective directions, while player two (the blue racket)
controls the WASD keys. Each goal is worth one point. The pineapple is
first hit to player one, and after each goal, it goes to the player who
hit the goal. The player who scores ten points first wins the game.
To reset the game, press R on the keyboard.
